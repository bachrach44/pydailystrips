pydailystrips
=============

A python replacement for the old comics page reader, dailystrips.

Goals:
* Use the dailystrips comics definition format for interoperability
* Update everything
* Run in python
* Use github to keep the comic definitions up to date. (A major gripe of mine with the old dailystrips which hasn't been updated in years).
